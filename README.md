### Introduction
After searching for arcade games options to develop, I decided to go with Space Invaders, a retro game inspired by The War of the Worlds and still very popular.

### User Stories:

* As a game player:
    * I want to easily find the instructions for the game.
    * I want to find the start button.
    * I want to find a FAQ menu with frequently answered questions.
    * I want to be able to play by using my keyboard.
    * I want to find a share button to share with my friends.
    * I want to see my earned points.
    * I want to be able to level up in the game.

### Development - Day 1
**Planning:** Planning: Firstly, I outlined the basic functions and features for the game according to the user stories. 

I also followed the wireframes presented, that shows the starting button, instructions for the player and the scoreboard. 

The type of game is 2D.


#### 1. The play area: 
* Made using the HTML tag ```<canvas>```.
* As a font, I used 'Press Start 2P' for the title.
* The graphics are from iStock standard license.

#### 2. Characters:
* One player as a defender.
* 4 types of invaders.
* Background: sky space.

#### 3. Winner decision:
* Player fires bullets and hits all enemies (**player wins**).
* Enemies fire a single bullet and hit the player (**enemy wins**).
* Enemies collide with players (**enemy wins**).
* Enemies cross the bottom border (**enemy wins**).

#### 4. Score:
For every bullet hit on an enemy, the player receives **50** points.

#### 5. Methodology approach:
I used this project to explore new concepts in game development using JavaScript. For this I have searched for examples, tutorials and also contacted experienced developers.

#### Initial coding:
The JavaScript project has been divided into `classes` in order to prevent conflicted code and apply more organisation. There are the classes:

1. ```Player```: Functions of the player, size and `keydown` and `keyup` ```.addEventListener``` to move the player.
2. ```MovingDirection```: For the enemy moving down the screen.
3. ```Enemy```: For the enemy images, size and collision.
4. ```EnemyMotion```: Functions for the behaviour of the enemy, fire bullets, move down and velocity.
5. ```Bullet```: Determine bullet for the player, size, quantity, velocity and collision with enemy.
6. ```BulletMotion```: Functions regarding the player's bullet, shoot sound, collision detected with enemy for scoring.
7. ```Score```: Regarding the score for the player, to be given when the player bullet collides with the enemy.

### Day 2
1. Committed the code for the enemy moves.
2. Committed the code for the player moves.
3. Committed the code for the action scene (hits, bullets motion and sounds).
4. Integrate a button from Bootstrap to RESTART the game.
5. Integrated a message to show if a player wins or loses.
6. Integrated the score points to show on HTML.

#### Enemy decision and map
I have used an array of arrays to draw an enemy map for the canvas. Every enemy has a number which shows on the screen according to the map, the enemy numbered 0 would show an empty space.

This code is in the class ***EnemyMotion.js*** and imported into the ***main.js***.
```
enemyMap = [
        [2,2,2,1,1,4,1,4,4,1],
        [1,3,1,1,4,1,2,3,1,1],
        [1,1,4,1,1,2,1,4,1,2],
        [4,1,2,1,3,1,2,4,3,1],
        [1,1,4,1,1,4,1,2,2,2],
        [2,1,3,1,4,1,3,3,1,1]
    ];
```

I used the code below to generate the number of the enemies in order to show on the game.
This code is in the ***Enemy.js*** class and imported into the class ***EnemyMotion.js***
```
this.image = new Image()
        this.image.src = `/assets/images/enemy${imageNumber}.png`;
```

#### Bug detected and solution:
While implementing the start button, I detected that the ```<canvas>``` of the game became a white background.

``` 
// ------ Paused code ------ //
// let started = false;
// $("#start-game-btn").click(function() {
//     if (started == false) {
    
//         setInterval(game,1000/60);

//         started = true;
//     }
// }) 
```

#### Solution:
As a **solution** I decided to change the button for a **restart** instead, that means, when the user enters the page for the first time, it will start the game automatically. Once the player loses or wins, then the button will show for the user to **restart** the game by clicking it and reloading the page.

```
$("#start-game").show();

$('#start-game').click(function() {
    location.reload();
});
```
It was a DRY approach and easier to apply.

### Day 3
1. Tested the game.
2. Fixed bugs.
3. Added responsive layout.
4. Styled the game with colour and background.

#### Bug detected
The layout was not responsive, the scoreboard was coming in front of the game canvas.

I tried to implement a responsive design, however I was already within the deadline and I had to pause the implementation.

The game is not fully responsive at the moment, but this is noted to be implemented as a future enhancement.

### Favourite function

#### Collision detection {[mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection)}
This was quite challenging to align the 2D axis to identify the collision for **enemies, player, bullets and border**.

***

### Parked "nice to have" function
The initial plan was to have a level up function, however I decided to leave only a restart button for now.

### "Nice to have" future iterations
1. For each type of enemy apply a different score point.
2. Apply 'lives' for the player, so the player can lose after being hit by three enemy's bullets.
3. Insert loops of enemies to show, so more enemies would appear automatically on top instead of finishing the game.
4. Apply more velocity for next levels.
5. More powerful different enemies, e.g.: Some need 3 shoots to die.

***

### Challenges 
The main challenge was to decide the development process, my first decision was to use one `main.js` file, but as I started developing I also realised that the code would be too long and confusing.

After I did some research, I decided to implement classes while importing and dividing the code into smaller parts.

### Wins
I had the opportunity to implement a project from concept to completion, while improving my Web development skills. I enjoy applying styling as well as coding the main functions to make the game fully working.

Although it was a solo project, I worked with time management in mind in order to achieve the deadline.
